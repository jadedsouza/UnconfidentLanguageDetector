Dear Joshua, 

So, I’d like to ask to postpone my project until next week. 

Between all my outside commitments, I guess have fallen behind. I could pull it all together, but I am worried of where I am with my project. 

I’m also confused of whats expected of me, if that makes sense.

Thanks,
Michelle
