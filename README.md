# Unconfident Language Detector
Prototype to replace words and phrases in emails that sounded less confident to help women gain more respect in their workplace and receive projects that take advantage of their entire skillset. <br>

Put in your email through the sampleText.txt file (or make you own .txt file) and run it through the java file! When running the code, do type the input text file as sampleText.txt and not just sampleText! :) <br>
<br>
## Things I want to complete soon: <br>
* Need to make a front end for accessibility. Also would avoid all the file creation and complications through .txt vs other files types vs not putting in the file type stuff. <br>
* Never uploaded it to GitHub, so somehow my replacing and deleting files went missing. Working on the replacing text, delete.txt is done I think. <br>
* Organize! <br>
